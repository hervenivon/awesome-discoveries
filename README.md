# Awesome-discoveries

This repository hosts a curated list of useful, inspiring, fascinating, and eclectic discoveries and thoughts I made and produced during my readings, experiments and job decisions making being a startup advisor and the CTO of a world leading drone company. Some topics are highly technical; some are not.

This repository uses the `hugo` static site generator along with the "Book" template. The result is hosted on AWS Amplify.

To get a hugo static site generation template working with AWS Amplify please refer to my other repository [hugo-book-amplify-template](https://github.com/hervenivon/hugo-book-amplify-template).

The building results of this repository is automatically published on [hervenivon.io](https://hervenivon.io).

## üõ† Development

Once you have configured the Amplify Console deployment process from the previous paragraph, every time you push or you do a pull request, the Amplify Console will trigger a build and deployment pipeline.

If you want to see locally what is your impact on your `markdown` content change, please execute the following in your favorite terminal (with the Hugo Pre requisites applied) and the git submodule updated: `git submodule update --recursive --init`

```bash
hugo server -D
```

It will compiled your static web site content, include draft in process and launch a live reloading local server serving your content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hugo's theme configuration

Please refer to [Book configuration](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-book/#configuration) paragraph.
